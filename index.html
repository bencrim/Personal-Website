        <p class="intro">I'm currently a third year computer science student in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University. I'm always looking to learn new things in the world of computer science. At present I'm interested in computer graphics and how visuals are rendered on a screen. <br> 
        <br>
        When I'm not busy doing homework for my classes, you can find me collaborating with my teammates on the MSU STARX team (link)...and when I'm not busy with STARX you can find me playing games on my PC. I have a blog (link) I update every now and then with my favorite games and my reviews of them. <br> 
        <br>
        This summer I'll be returning to Rocket Mortgage for my second term as a Software Engineer Intern (link).</p>

              <h2>Club Overview</h2>
              <p class="center">MSU STrength Augmenting Robotic eXoskeleton (STARX) is a student-run engineering organization that aims to develop a wearable exoskeleton suit that can enhance a user's physical abilities.  STARX comprises engineering students of all backgrounds who specialize in the exo-suit's bio-mechanics, electronics, programming, and hardware. The club was founded in 2017, and is currently on it's third major iteration of the suit. The team competes at the end of every school year against similar teams around the nation, last year we won 2nd place.</p>

              <h2>EHS Team Lead</h2>
              <p class="center">After completing my first year in the club, I was elected to be the Embedded Hardware Systems team lead. In this position, I led the development of the control system that moved the actuators. To do this, we used accelerometers to calculate the angular velocity of the pilots leg, which would then be run through calculations to determine the correct output from the Arduino's to the actuators. This system seemed to work all the way up until competition week, where we decided to scrap the whole system and rethink of a way to move the actuators correctly. After many hours of development, we came to a solution that sacrificed reactivity for simplicity.</p>

              <h2>Chief Engineer (current)</h2>
              <p class="center">After my second year, I was voted to be Chief Engineer of the team. This role oversees every sub-team and their progress, along with being the vice president of the club. I am required to have the most comprehensive knowledge on how the suit is designed, and I must approve all projects before they are put to production. So far, I've been able to simply act as vice president for the team, given our large backlog of projects to complete. However, I plan to spearhead our upper-body development once we have the freedom to do so.</p>

            Communication - I strived to work well with everyone on the team. I was eventually able to communicate with and help a few senior-level engineers with their work.<br> 
            <br>
            Problem Solving - Every task I was given presented a new challenge to overcome. Over time I learned how best to approach new topics and learn what I need to complete my work.</p>
